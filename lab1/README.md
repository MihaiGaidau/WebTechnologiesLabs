# REPORT

In this laboratory work I got familiar with different html structures like containers, carosels navigation bars an footers. Also I used css to improve the view of each page.
I used bootstrap to make the pages to make changes when it has small or big dimensions in order to improve the navigation.

**Observations**

Since I am using bootstrap for the first time, I understant that it is realy an useful thing. I observed that, in order to use _bootstrap_ correctly I have to divide the page in some fragments.
Also, I have to specify when (for what dimension), and what (to select by _class_ or _id_) to make changes.

I also observed that I can use boostrap in 2 ways:

1. With it's source code
2. With the links to it's source code

_here I used it with the links_

**Conclusion**

In this laboratory work, I understand how to use boostrap, how to change the style of a page using css and how to use a lot of html features.
In order to improve the experience with the site, I create more that one page.
