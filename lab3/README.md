# REPORT Laboratory nr 3,4
**Objective:**

* Connect with a database
* Add users

In laboratory work nr 3 I had to connect my app to a database, so I created a database of restaurants. A user can add restaurants. The Edit is not working very well, it sad that I didn't set the id for the midified object, but the interesting thing is that  I modify the selected object, so It has the Id. I readly don't know what to do. I've searched about this, but I don't find an answer.

In the laboratory work nr 4, I have added users. It has no admin users, but in order to view the list of restaurants you have to have to log in. One of the feature of application is that is keeping sesion even if you close the application. 

It was interesting working with ASP.NET MVC, and I 've learned a lot about arhitecture and how the web sites are done.
