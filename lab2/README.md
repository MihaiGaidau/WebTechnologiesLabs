**Objective:**

* Get familiar with MVC pattern

Framework: **ASP.NET**
ASP.NET MVC gives you a powerful, patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and that gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development. ASP.NET MVC includes many features that enable fast, TDD-friendly development for creating sophisticated applications that use the latest web standards.
ASP.NET MVC allows software developers to build a web application as a composition of three roles: Model, View and Controller
1. *Model* - represents the state of a particular aspect of the application
2. *View* - accepts necessary information from the controller and renders a user interface to display that information
3. *Controller* - handles interactions and updates the model to reflect a change in state of the application, and then passes information to the view

In this laboratory work I optained experinece with working with a MVC pattern. Fist of all, I integrated my first laboratory with the MVC, In order to ot to write to much code, I used the ASP.NET feature of layers, that create a file, where is some code, that I can insert in another page, using just a link.

Another feature of the MVC is "bundles", that creates a virtual link of css or js files that can be included by virtual link in every file
